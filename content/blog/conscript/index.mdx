## A new start

Feels weird but here I am, as a conscript soldier. I've always detested this day as a child, fearing that 2 whole years of my life would be wasted in the military. As this day inched closer, I started to feel a tinge of excitement, which was pretty weird to say the least. And honestly, it hasn't been that bad.
